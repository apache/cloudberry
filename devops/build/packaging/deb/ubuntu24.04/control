Description: Apache Cloudberry (incubating) is an advanced, open-source, massively
  parallel processing (MPP) data warehouse developed from PostgreSQL and
  Greenplum. It is designed for high-performance analytics on
  large-scale data sets, offering powerful analytical capabilities and
  enhanced security features.
  Key Features:
    - Massively parallel processing for optimized performance
    - Advanced analytics for complex data processing
    - Integration with ETL and BI tools
    - Compatibility with multiple data sources and formats
    - Enhanced security features
  Apache Cloudberry supports both batch processing and real-time data
  warehousing, making it a versatile solution for modern data
  environments.
  Apache Cloudberry (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at
  the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache
  Incubator PMC.
  Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further
  review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision
  making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
  successful ASF projects.
  While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
  completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the
  project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
