## Manual Workflow Triggers

Many workflows support manual triggering via `workflow_dispatch`, allowing developers to run CI jobs on-demand.

### How to Manually Trigger a Workflow

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select the workflow from the left sidebar (e.g., "Build and Test Cloudberry")
3. Click **Run workflow** button (top right)
4. Select your branch
5. Configure input parameters (if available)
6. Click **Run workflow**

### Workflow Input Parameters

#### `build-cloudberry.yml` - Main CI

| Parameter | Description | Default | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `test_selection` | Comma-separated list of tests to run, or "all" | `all` | `ic-good-opt-off,ic-contrib` |
| `reuse_artifacts_from_run_id` | Run ID to reuse build artifacts from (see below) | _(empty)_ | `12345678901` |

**Available test selections:**
- `all` - Run all test suites
- `ic-good-opt-off` - Installcheck with optimizer off
- `ic-good-opt-on` - Installcheck with optimizer on
- `ic-contrib` - Contrib extension tests
- `ic-resgroup` - Resource group tests
- `ic-resgroup-v2` - Resource group v2 tests
- `ic-resgroup-v2-memory-accounting` - Resource group memory tests
- `ic-singlenode` - Single-node mode tests
- `make-installcheck-world` - Full test suite
- And more... (see workflow for complete list)

## Artifact Reuse for Faster Testing

When debugging test failures, rebuilding Cloudberry (~50-70 minutes) on every iteration is inefficient. The artifact reuse feature allows you to reuse build artifacts from a previous successful run.

### How It Works

1. Build artifacts (RPMs, source tarballs) from a previous workflow run are downloaded
2. Build job is skipped (saves ~45-60 minutes)
3. RPM installation test is skipped (saves ~5-10 minutes)
4. Test jobs run with the reused artifacts
5. You can iterate on test configurations without rebuilding

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Find the Run ID

After a successful build (even if tests failed), get the run ID:

**Option A: From GitHub Actions UI**
- Go to **Actions** tab → Click on a completed workflow run
- The URL will be: `https://github.com/apache/cloudberry/actions/runs/12345678901`
- The run ID is `12345678901`

**Option B: From GitHub API**
```bash
# List recent workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=build-cloudberry.yml --limit 5

# Get run ID from specific branch
gh run list --workflow=build-cloudberry.yml --branch=my-feature --limit 1
```

#### 2. Trigger New Run with Artifact Reuse

**Via GitHub UI:**
1. Go to **Actions** → **Build and Test Cloudberry**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Enter the run ID in **"Reuse build artifacts from a previous run ID"**
4. Optionally customize **test_selection**
5. Click **Run workflow**

**Via GitHub CLI:**
```bash
# Reuse artifacts from run 12345678901, run only specific tests
gh workflow run build-cloudberry.yml \
  --field reuse_artifacts_from_run_id=12345678901 \
  --field test_selection=ic-good-opt-off
```

#### 3. Monitor Test Execution

- Build job will be skipped (shows as "Skipped" in Actions UI)
- RPM Install Test will be skipped
- Test jobs will run with artifacts from the specified run ID
- Total time: ~15-30 minutes (vs ~65-100 minutes for full build+test)

### Use Cases

**Debugging a specific test failure:**
```bash
# Run 1: Full build + all tests (finds test failure in ic-good-opt-off)
gh workflow run build-cloudberry.yml

# Get the run ID from output
RUN_ID=$(gh run list --workflow=build-cloudberry.yml --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')

# Run 2: Reuse artifacts, run only failing test
gh workflow run build-cloudberry.yml \
  --field reuse_artifacts_from_run_id=$RUN_ID \
  --field test_selection=ic-good-opt-off
```

**Testing different configurations:**
```bash
# Test with optimizer off, then on, using same build
gh workflow run build-cloudberry.yml \
  --field reuse_artifacts_from_run_id=$RUN_ID \
  --field test_selection=ic-good-opt-off

gh workflow run build-cloudberry.yml \
  --field reuse_artifacts_from_run_id=$RUN_ID \
  --field test_selection=ic-good-opt-on
```

### Limitations

- Artifacts expire after 90 days (GitHub default retention)
- Run ID must be from the same repository (or accessible fork)
- Artifacts must include both RPM and source build artifacts
- Cannot reuse artifacts across different OS/architecture combinations
- Changes to source code require a fresh build

## Running Workflows in Forked Repositories

GitHub Actions workflows are enabled in forks, allowing you to validate changes before submitting a Pull Request.

### Initial Setup (One-Time)

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account

2. **Enable GitHub Actions** in your fork:
   - Go to your fork's **Actions** tab
   - Click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**

3. **Configure secrets** (if needed for advanced features):
   - Go to fork **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
   - Most workflows don't require additional secrets

### Workflow Behavior in Forks

- ✅ **Automated triggers work**: Push and PR events trigger workflows
- ✅ **Manual triggers work**: `workflow_dispatch` is fully functional
- ✅ **Artifact reuse works**: Can reuse artifacts from previous runs in your fork
- ⚠️ **Cross-fork artifact reuse**: Not supported (security restriction)
- ⚠️ **Some features may be limited**: Certain features requiring organization-level secrets may not work

### Best Practices for Fork Development

1. **Test locally first** when possible (faster iteration)
2. **Use manual triggers** to avoid burning GitHub Actions minutes unnecessarily
3. **Use artifact reuse** to iterate on test failures efficiently
4. **Push to feature branches** to trigger automated CI
5. **Review Actions tab** to ensure workflows completed successfully before opening PR

### Example Fork Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch in fork
git checkout -b fix-test-failure

# 2. Make changes and push to fork
git commit -am "Fix test failure"
git push origin fix-test-failure

# 3. CI runs automatically on push

# 4. If tests fail, iterate using artifact reuse
# Get run ID from your fork's Actions tab
gh workflow run build-cloudberry.yml \
  --field reuse_artifacts_from_run_id=12345678901 \
  --field test_selection=ic-good-opt-off

# 5. Once tests pass, open PR to upstream
gh pr create --web
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Build job was skipped but tests failed to start"

**Cause:** Artifacts from specified run ID not found or expired

**Solution:**
- Verify the run ID is correct
- Check that run completed successfully (built artifacts)
- Run a fresh build if artifacts expired (>90 days)

### "Workflow not found in fork"

**Cause:** GitHub Actions not enabled in fork

**Solution:**
- Go to fork's **Actions** tab
- Click to enable workflows

### "Resource not accessible by integration"

**Cause:** Workflow trying to access artifacts from different repository

**Solution:**
- Can only reuse artifacts from same repository
- Run a fresh build in your fork first, then reuse those artifacts
