      Thanks for proposing major changes to Apache Cloudberry!
      
      When changes are just minor updates, general bug fixes, just Pull Request directly! 
      
      When you just have one idea or more `casual` feature request, consider choosing [Ideas / Feature Requests](https://github.com/apache/cloudberry/discussions/new?category=ideas-feature-requests).
      
      But any of the following can be considered a major change that needs to have **Proposal**.
      
      * Any change that impacts the public interfaces of the project. 
      
      * Any new component, module or code that introduces a new concept into the project or alters the behavior of an existing one
      
      * Any large code refactor to address general code re-usability and structure.
