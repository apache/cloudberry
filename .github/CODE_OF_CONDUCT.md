# Greengage DB Community Code of Conduct

Greengage DB is an open community project. Every Greengage DB user or developer is responsible for making the community a place where people want to come back. We expect all community members to maintain professional ethics and communicate respectfully and politely.

## Community Development Principles

In developing code, documentation, and any other products of intellectual work, we are guided by principles that are important for the development of the community.

**Collaboration**

Anyone can join the Greengage DB community and make a contribution.

**Equality**

The contribution of each community member will be assessed equally, based on its objective significance for the project.

**Opportunities**

Community members who contribute to Greengage DB can influence the direction of the product's development.

**Availability**

The project code will be distributed under an open license for community members anywhere in the world.

## Code of Conduct in Action

This code of conduct applies to all available channels of interaction between community members, including comments on code or documentation, the project's social media, and online and offline events that are partially or fully dedicated to Greengage DB.

Every member of the Greengage DB community is expected to adhere to the project’s code of conduct, especially when speaking on behalf of Greengage DB in the public space.
We encourage everyone to be interested in Greengage DB, regardless of their track record or formal qualifications. This does not negate the important procedures for code and documentation quality, but it does require respectful and polite treatment.

The Greengage DB project exists thanks to the voluntary contributions of its members. Some of them may leave the project over time, and this decision should be respected in the same way as their initial involvement. We expect this code of conduct to be followed in the event of parting with the project, and the departing community member is supposed to treat those who remain with respect.

## Appropriate Conduct

No personal characteristics can serve as grounds for refusing to work for the benefit of the Greengage DB project or belittling your contribution to it. This code of conduct considers any attacks on a person unacceptable. These are the basic principles of communication in the community.

Unacceptable behavior is any threat to use violence, damage social or professional reputation, expressed to an individual or a group of people. Threats to damage the Greengage DB project or its reputation or the implementation of such threats are also a violation of this code of conduct. Harassment of any kind and violation of the basic principles of communication are not tolerated in the Greengage DB community.

In the event of receiving a warning about inappropriate behavior, it is necessary to immediately stop it. Subsequent violations of the Code of Conduct will serve as grounds for taking restrictive measures against the violator, up to and including exclusion from the community.

## Reporting

In many cases, simply sending a link to this code of conduct will be enough to maintain a good community culture. If you see a discussion where the code may potentially be violated, proactively send a link to it.
In some cases, violations may require issuing warnings and other restrictive measures. In this case, please contact us at **code@greengagedb.org**.
